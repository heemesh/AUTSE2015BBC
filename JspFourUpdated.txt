        <center><h1>Empirical studies of agile software development: A systematic review</h1></center>
        
        <center><h4>Abstract: </h4></center>
        <center><h7>Agile software development represents a major departure from traditional, 
                plan-based approaches to software engineering. A systematic review of empirical 
                studies of agile software development up to and including 2005 was conducted. 
                The search strategy identified 1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as 
                empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and 
                adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative 
                studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and 
                limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for 
                research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need 
                for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common 
                research agenda. For the industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, 
                according to topic, that can be compared for relevance to their own settings and situations.
