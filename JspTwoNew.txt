        <center><h1>The Making of Cloud Applications An Empirical Study on Software Development for the Cloud</h1></center>
        
        <center><h4>Abstract: </h4></center>
        <center><h7>Cloud computing is gaining more and more traction as a deployment and provisioning model for software. 
                While a large body of research already covers how to optimally operate a cloud system, 
                we still lack insights into how professional software engineers actually use clouds, 
                and how the cloud impacts development practices. This paper reports on the first systematic study on 
                how software developers build applications in the cloud. We conducted a mixed-method study, consisting of 
                qualitative interviews of 25 professional developers and a quantitative survey with 294 responses. 
                Our results show that adopting the cloud has a profound impact throughout the software development 
                process, as well as on how developers utilize tools and data in their daily work. Among other things, 
                we found that (1) developers need better means to anticipate runtime problems and rigorously define 
                metrics for improved fault localization and (2) the cloud offers an abundance of operational data, 
                however, developers still often rely on their experience and intuition rather than utilizing metrics. 
                From our findings, we extracted a set of guidelines for cloud development and identified challenges for 
                researchers and tool vendors.
