        <center><h1>A Simulation Model for the Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle</h1></center>
        
        <center><h4>Abstract: </h4></center>
        <center><h7>Software development life cycle or SDLC for short is a methodology for designing, 
                building, and maintaining information and industrial systems. So far, there exist many 
                SDLC models, one of which is the Waterfall model which comprises five phases to be 
                completed sequentially in order to develop a software solution. However, SDLC of 
                software systems has always encountered problems and limitations that resulted in 
                significant budget overruns, late or suspended deliveries, and dissatisfied clients. 
                The major reason for these deficiencies is that project directors are not wisely 
                assigning the required number of workers and resources on the various activities of 
                the SDLC. Consequently, some SDLC phases with insufficient resources may be delayed; 
                while, others with excess resources may be idled, leading to a bottleneck between the 
                arrival and delivery of projects and to a failure in delivering an operational product 
                on time and within budget. This paper proposes a simulation model for the Waterfall 
                development process using the Simphony.NET simulation tool whose role is to assist 
                project managers in determining how to achieve the maximum productivity with the minimum 
                number of expenses, workers, and hours. It helps maximizing the utilization of development 
                processes by keeping all employees and resources busy all the time to keep pace with the
                arrival of projects and to decrease waste and idle time. As future work, other SDLC models 
                such as spiral and incremental are to be simulated, giving project executives the choice to 
                use a diversity of software development methodologies.
